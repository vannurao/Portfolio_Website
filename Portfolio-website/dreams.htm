                    <p class="text-gray">Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity. A billion is a big number, but we know we can do it together. Help plant trees today!

                    <p class="text-gray">Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we've come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.

                    <p class="text-gray">Farming is growing crops and keeping animals for food and raw materials. Farming is a part of agriculture. Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is. The development of farming gave rise to the Neolithic Revolution as people gave up nomadic hunting and became settlers in cities.
